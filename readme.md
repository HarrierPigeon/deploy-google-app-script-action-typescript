# Deploy Google App Script Action

[![Deploy Script](https://github.com/HarrierPigeon/deploy-google-app-script-action/actions/workflows/deploy-script.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/HarrierPigeon/deploy-google-app-script-action/actions/workflows/deploy-script.yml)

This repository is an example of how to setup an automatic [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) process for [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

*forked from [https://github.com/ericanastas/deploy-google-app-script-action](ericanastas/deploy-google-app-script-action)*
 - major changes:
   - saves extra [GitHub action context data](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context) data in a object stored in ``git-info.js``
   - adds the ability to have a document container by setting ``PARENT_ID`` in actions secrets.
   - ``commitTracker.js`` will automatically log whenever the script in GAS gets updated if you set up a recurring trigger for it.
    - at present, this requires a parent container.

## Why?

This is useful if you want to work from a nicer editor than the built-in Google one (ie vsCode) and use GitHub for version control & etc.  There's probably a better thing to use for standalone GAS scripts or stuff that uses features of GCP, but if you don't have access to GCP because your organization locked down your gSuite access a little too much, this is a nice alternative.

## Setup

### Setup Project Files

1. Install [clasp](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp) on your development machine if not already installed.
2. Create a local copy of a Google Apps Script project. You may use `clasp create` to create a new project or `clasp clone` to download an existing project. This will create a `.clasp.json` file.
3. Initialize the project folder as a new Git repo: `git init`. 
   1. The `.clasp.json` file created in the prior step MUST be in the root of the Git repository, 
   2. `.clasp.json` may point to source files in a sub folder throgh a `rootDir` property. 
4. Copy `.github/workflows/deploy-script.yml` from this repository to the same relative path.


#### `.clasp.json` File Format Reference

    {
        "scriptId": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";        
        "rootDir": "src",
        "projectId": "project-id-0000000000000000000",
        "fileExtension": "js",
        "filePushOrder": ["src/File1.js", "src/File1.js", "src/File1.js"],
        "parentId": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    }


### Setup Git Repository

1. Stage files: `git add .`
2. Commit files: `git commit -m "first commit"`
3. Create a `develop` branch: `git branch -M develop`
4. Create a `main` branch: `git branch -M main`
5.  Create a new GitHub repository, and add it as a remote: `git remote add origin git@github.com:account/repo.git`
6.  Push the `main` branch to GitHub: `git push -u origin main`
7. Push the `develop` branch to GitHub: `git push -u origin develop`

At this point the workflow will be triggered, but will fail because it is not configured completely.

### Set Repository Secrets

[Github encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) are used to configure the workflow and can be set from the repository settings page on GitHub.
#### `CLASPRC_JSON`

The `clasp` command line tool uses a `.clasprc.json` file to store the current login information. The contents of this file need to be added to a `CLASPRC_JSON` secret to allow the workflow to update and deploy scripts.

1. Login to clasp as the user that should run the workflow: 
   1. Run `clasp login` 
   2. A web browser will open asking you to authenticate clasp. Accept this from the account you want the workflow to use.
2. Open the `.clasprc.json` file that is created in the home directory (`C:\Users\{username}` on windows, and `~/.clasprc.json` on Linux)
3. Copy the contents of `.clasprc.json` into a new secret named `CLASPRC_JSON`

#### `REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN`
A GitHub personal access token must be provided to the workfow to allow it to update the `CLASPRC_JSON` secret configured about when tokens expire and refresh.

1. Create a new [GitHubpersonal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with `repo` scope.
2. Copy the token into a new secret named `REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN`

#### `SCRIPT_ID` [OPTIONAL]

The clasp command line tool identifies the Google Apps Script project to push and deploy too using the `scriptId` property in `.clasp.json`. You may leave this value hard coded in `.clasp.json` or you may have this set dynamically. To specify the target script dynamically add a `SCRIPT_ID` secret to the repository. This will cause the workflow to override whatever literal scriptId value is in `.clasp.json`

#### `PARENT_ID` [OPTIONAL]

This is for projects that have a container document, such as a spreadsheet. Similar to `SCRIPT_ID`, You can leave this value hard coded in `.clasp.json` or you may have this set dynamically. To specify the target script dynamically add a `PARENT_ID` secret to the repository. This will cause the workflow to override whatever the literal ``parentId`` value is in `.clasp.json`

#### `DEPLOYMENT_ID` [OPTIONAL]

The workflow can automatically deploy the script when the `main` branch is pushed to github.

1. Determine the ID of the deployment you want
   1. Create a new deployment by running `clasp deploy` or on https://scripts.google.com.
   2. Find the deploymen id by running `clasp deployments` or checking the projet settings on https://scripts.google.com.
2. Add the desired deployment id to a secret naned `DEPLOYMENT_ID`
## Usage

- Pushing to either the `main` or `develop` branches on github will automatically trigger the workflow to push the code to the `HEAD` deployment on https://scripts.google.com`
- If the `DEPLOYMENT_ID` secret has been setup pushing to `main` will also deploy the script to the specified deployment.

## Updating `.clasprc.json`

The `.clasprc.json` file that stores the authentication information contains a `access_token` which expires at the specified `expiry_date` and a `refresh_token` that can be used to request a new `access_token`. These tokens will change over time, but the workflow should update the `CLASPRC_JSON` repository secret.

However, there are [conditions where the refresh token may also expire](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#expiration). So in addition to the push triggers the workflow is also configured to automatically attempt to login to clasp once a week which will confirm the authentication is still working and potentially refresh and save new tokens.

### `.clasprc.json` File Format Reference

    {
        "access_token": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
        "refresh_token": "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY",
        "scope": "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.projects https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script ...",
        "token_type": "Bearer",
        "expiry_date": 0000000000000
    }

## GCP Service Accounts

The whole system described here copying the credentials out of `.clasprc.json` and using a scheduled trigger to automatically update the tokens on a regular basis is a hack. 

The "correct" way to setup a server to server connection like is through a GCP service account. It is possible to login clasp using a key file for a service account. However, the [Apps Scripts API](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/api/concepts) does not work with service accounts.
